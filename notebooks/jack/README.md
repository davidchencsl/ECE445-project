## 2023-03-28 - PCB Initial Check
The PCB board order has arrived on 03/28 and an initial check was conducted. After examining the PCB board and the electronic pieces to be soldered, one severe problem has revealed. The planned ESP32 pin layout on the PCB board does not match the ESP32 chip we have. Two solutions have been proposed: we reorder a new PCB board with updated pin layout with the ESP32 chip we have right now, or order additional ESP32 chips with matched pin layout with the PCB board we have right now. We decide to discuss with our TA about this issue before proceeding.

Luckily we were able to obtain a legacy ESP32 from previous semesters' left-overs with matching pin layout as out PCB board.
